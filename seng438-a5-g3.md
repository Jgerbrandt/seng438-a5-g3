Result of Model Comparison:
Using the C-SFRAT tool, multiple models were able to be compared in order to discover the most accurate model to depict the data analyzed. The following methods were compared using this tool:
-IFR generalized Salvia & Bollinger
-S Distribution
-Discrete Weibull (Order 2)
-Discrete Weibull (Type III)
-Geometric
-Negative Binomial (Order 2)
-Truncated Logistic

The two most effective models found were the S Distribution and Negative Binomial (Order 2) methods. Using the C-SFRAT tool, Model Comparison was used to deduce these two models as the most effective. As shown in the figure below, these 2 models have the closest Critic to 1. This points to these models being the most accuate to the input data.
