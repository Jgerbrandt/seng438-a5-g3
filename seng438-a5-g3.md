Result of Model Comparison:
Using the C-SFRAT tool, multiple models were able to be compared in order to discover the most accurate model to depict the data analyzed. The following methods were compared using this tool:
-IFR generalized Salvia & Bollinger
-S Distribution
-Discrete Weibull (Order 2)
-Discrete Weibull (Type III)
-Geometric
-Negative Binomial (Order 2)
-Truncated Logistic

The two most effective models found were the S Distribution and Negative Binomial (Order 2) methods. Using the C-SFRAT tool, Model Comparison was used to deduce these two models as the most effective. As shown in the figure below, these 2 models have the closest Critic to 1. This points to these models being the most accuate to the input data.

Additionally, the MVF and Intensity Graphs for these two models can be seen labelled below.

Range Analysis:
Data ranges had to be analyzed in order for the tool to extrapolate the models and predict future failures. As other tools were unable to work and C-SFRAT was unable to calculate calculate Laplace tests, the ranges were set to extrapolate 20 intervals past the end of the data. Ideally, the Laplace test would be able to determine an optimal range to calculate this bound. However, due to the constraints of the software used, the range of 20 intervals was chosen.
